# profiler-syntax-highlighting

This npm module provides syntax highlighting for source code, via a synchronous, per-line API.
It was originally designed for use in the [Firefox Profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/)
but will probably not be used there because it is too slow for long files, and the synchronous
approach isn't workable.

```js
const { SyntaxParsedFile } = await import('profiler-syntax-highlighting');
const source = `#include <iostream>
/**
 * Comment
 */`;
const file = new SyntaxParsedFile("cpp", source);
console.log(file.getHTMLForLine(2));
file.free(); // needed to free up wasm memory
```

Output:

```
<span class="source c++"><span class="comment block c"> * Comment</span></span>
```

## Description

`getHTMLForLine` returns self-contained HTML code for each line of source code.
This makes it perfect for use in a virtualized list.

The HTML code does not contain any inline styles. You need to provide your own
CSS to achieve actual syntax highlighting.

You can generate stylesheets from Sublime Text themes using the `synhtml-css-classes`
example in the [`syntect` repository](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/).

### Motivation

I made this library because none of the other JS syntax highlighting packages
on npm did what I need. The one that came closest to serving my needs was
[`refractor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/refractor). First I was trying to use it
via [`react-syntax-highlighter`](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter)
but I think I came to the conclusion that the only way to get virtualized list
rendering with it was to do per-line parsing. So lines in the middle of multi-line
comments would not be known to be inside a comment, because each line was parsed
individually.

I had high hopes for this module: I was expecting it to be fast and that it would allow
excellent styling abilities because of the versatile "scopes" / class names which
are applied to the code fragments.

However, this did not turn out to be the case.

### Implementation and Performance

The implementation uses [`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/) with the `fancy_regex` backend.
Parsing is done on-demand inside `getHTMLForLine`, synchronously.
For very long files, if your first call to `getHTMLForLine` is for a line number
towards the end of the file, the call might take up to a second to complete.

Repeated parsing is minimized as much as possible by storing checkpoints
at a regular line interval.

After trying this out, I was very disappointed with the performance in practice.

I was prepared for a somewhat sluggish first highlight. What I did not expect was that
"scrolling upwards", i.e. re-parsing lines above the last-parsed line, would also be
noticeably sluggish. That's despite this module's default behavior of storing a checkpoint
every 100 lines. Profile: https://share.firefox.dev/3dkffjv

I am now of the opinion that asynchronous, non-blocking parsing is the only option,
if you want to have fast and correct syntax highlighting. Adding asynchronicity would
make the API of this module rather complicated, so it's best to look for other existing
solutions.

For example, I will look into using CodeMirror instead, which has already solved this
complicated problem.
